# Python-Based Intrusion Detection System
  
**TODO:** This repo will contain the code for a network traffic monitoring Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that pairs anomaly-based and signature-based detection mechanisms. The IDS will be composed of four components: A) a packet capturing mechanism, B) traffic analyzer logic, C) a detection system, and D) a logging/alert mechanism.
